      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> Allana is a current Software Engineer at Codesmith. One of the reasons she likes working for them is because of their focus on cultivating a supportive community of like minded engineers. Other than her engineering work that involves helping them build, maintain and test consumer facing public applications, she also gets to teach and lead hour-long workshops on various technologies and concepts such as React, Redux, and TDD, to name a few. She loves helping others and seeing them experience "aha moments", creating clean and visually pleasing interfaces, and communicating and collaborating with her colleagues to figure out complex problems. With her free time, she likes contributing to open source. Last July, along with a small team of engineers, they launched Mongrove, an open-source MongoDB optimization cross-platform desktop tool, where she spearheaded and took ownership of handling the entire Front End experience. </p>
